//! This module exports a DNS resolver, which is also the default resolver used in the
//! [`crate::Endpoint`] if no custom resolver is configured.
//!
//! It also exports [`ResolverExt`]: A extension trait over [`DnsResolver`] to perform DNS queries
//! by ipv4, ipv6, name and node_id. See the [`node_info`] module documentation for details on how
//! iroh node records are structured.
